Case Study 1:
Mrs. Boateng, a 52-year-old teacher, came to the pharmacy complaining of a burning sensation in her chest after meals, especially at night. She said it worsens when she lies down immediately after eating. She occasionally takes antacids but is now looking for a longer-term solution. She has a history of hypertension and is currently on amlodipine. She's concerned about drug interactions.


Case Study 2:
Kwame, a 17-year-old high school student, visited the pharmacy feeling dizzy, tired, and easily out of breath during football practice.

He has no known chronic illness and hasn’t had any recent infections.


Case Study 3:
A market woman, Akosua, presented with itchy, scaly patches between her toes and under her breast fold. She said the itching worsens after long hours in the market under the sun. She's been using shea butter, but it's not helping. She has diabetes and is worried it might be related.


Case Study 4:
A known diabetic, Mr. Mensah, aged 61, was brought in by his daughter who noticed that he had been confused, vomiting, and breathing rapidly. He had missed his insulin doses for 3 days due to financial difficulties. On testing with a glucometer, his blood glucose read "HI". Emergency referral was advised.

Ama, a 3-year-old girl, was brought to the pharmacy by her mother. The child was irritable, had a fever, and had been pulling at her left ear. The mother noticed some pus-like discharge that morning. She was recently treated for a cold. The pharmacist examined the ear using an otoscope and saw a red, bulging tympanic membrane.


Case Study 6:
Yaw, a 25-year-old university student, complained of patchy, discolored spots on his chest and back. He said it started small but has now spread and is more noticeable after he tans. It’s not itchy but makes him self-conscious. He regularly plays sports and sweats a lot. He suspects it’s a “reaction to soap.”


Case Study 7:
Linda, a 30-year-old woman, rushed into the pharmacy with large, raised, itchy rashes on her arms and thighs. She had just eaten a peanut snack she hadn’t tried before. The rashes appeared within 15 minutes. She has no history of allergies and is very anxious about what’s happening to her skin.

Case Study 9:
A 7-year-old boy was brought to the pharmacy with honey-colored crusty sores around his nose and mouth. His mother said it started as small blisters and spread quickly after he scratched them.
