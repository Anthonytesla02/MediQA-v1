Recommended treatment: According to the Standard Treatment Guidelines, 7th Edition, 2017, the exact treatment for malaria is as follows: - For uncomplicated malaria: - Artemether-lumefantrine is the recommended first-line treatment for adults and children. - The dosage for adults is four tablets of artemether-lumefantrine (20mg/120mg) as a single dose, then four tablets after 8 hours, and then four tablets twice daily for the next 2 days. - The dosage for children is based on weight and should be determined by the healthcare provider. - Alternative treatments for uncomplicated malaria include artesunate-amodiaquine and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine. - For severe malaria: - Intravenous (IV) artesunate is the recommended first-line treatment for adults and children. - The dosage for adults is 2.4mg/kg at 0, 12, and 24 hours, and then once daily thereafter until the patient can tolerate oral medication. - The dosage for children is 3.0mg/kg at 0, 12, and 24 hours, and then once daily thereafter until the patient can tolerate oral medication. - If IV artesunate is not available, quinine or artemether can be used instead. Note: The guidelines do not contain specific information about the treatment of malaria during pregnancy or lactation. Healthcare providers should consult specialized guidelines for these populations.
