Chemical inflammation from concentrated bile salts follows, and secondary bacterial infection can occur. This creates a persistent inflammatory state with gallbladder wall edema and potential gangrene or perforation. Biliary colic, in contrast, involves temporary gallstone obstruction without inflammation, causing intermittent pain that resolves when the stone dislodges.

The sudden onset of left-sided weakness and slurred speech in a patient with atrial fibrillation strongly suggests a cardioembolic stroke. Urgent CT is necessary to rule out hemorrhage before considering thrombolytic therapy. The patient's use of warfarin and INR status are critical factors in determining eligibility for thrombolysis."
